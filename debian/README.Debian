== GNU Prolog for Debian ======================================================
-- PiLLoW library -------------------------------------------------------------

gprolog-pillow is a port of the PiLLoW package from UPM (see
http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/), adapted to work with GNU Prolog.

Shortly stated, PiLLoW allows for the creation of Prolog-based CGIs and, in
general, provides tool to manipulate SGML documents from within Prolog.
